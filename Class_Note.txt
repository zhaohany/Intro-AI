Tree search:
. Breadth-first search
• Uniform-cost search
• Depth-first search
• Depth-limited search
• Iterative deepening depth-first search
• Bidirectional search


Completeness: Is the algorith garanteed to find a solution when there is one?
Optimality: Find optimal solution?
Time Complexity: How long does it take to find?
Space Complexity:How much memory?

Compare performance:
b: maximum branching factor(Max number of children in each node)
d:depth of shallowest goal state
m: maximum length of path in the tree


-BFS: Breadth-First Search:

First in first out, finish each level First

     a
    b c
  d e  f g

a->b->c->d->e.....

This is Complete
No, not optimal in terms of real distance but optimal in terms of unit steps
because the result is the shallowest level.
Time: b^d
space: b^d

terrible in terms of algorith


-Depth-First search (DFS)
Last in first out: stack

Expand the deepest node in current search

complete? can run into infinity steps when repeate step are allowed.
DFS not optimal
Time:b^m m is the maximum depth if any node so worse tha  BFS
space: b*m    only o(m) using backtracking


-Depth-limite search:
depth limit l<d

time: b^l
space: b*l



-Interative dfs:
time:b^d
space: b*d
Optimality:yes



-bidirection search:
one from start, one from goal
complete like BFS
time:2b^(d/2)  ->  b^(d/2)
space: 2b^(d/2)  ->  b^(d/2)

-uniform-cost search

Best-First Search

Function F for search as evaluation function

Heuristic function h(n)  approximate cost from n to goal
GBFS(Greedy Best-first search)
if approximate distance is close  to real distance, then optimal

A* search

Most popular search algorithm
function g and function f
add approximate and traveled
chose min z=g+f

check the min one


approximate: admissible  never overtime cost: h<h*(true cost)

Optimality of A* search
Heuristic function is consistent: approximate h <= real h
It can always find the goal without infinite lopp because f value keep increasing
and it will find the small one(to ensure it not going backward)


manhattan distance

In real life, try different h function to see whitch one goes faster.


Evaluate heuristics functions:

evaluate the number of nodes expanded by a search technique

if h2 has an average a lower effective branching factor than h1

h2(n) >= h1(n)

h2 dominate h1


multi-heuristics

hmax=max(h1, h2, h....)

hmax is admissible and consistent if h1, h2,.... are admissible and consistent
